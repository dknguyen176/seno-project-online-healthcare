# Healthcare app 
Made by Nguyen Vu Dang Khoa and Le Minh Hoang.
This is a project for our Final exam on the course CS426 - Mobile Device Application Development.

Some special features of our app:
- Two separate interfaces for doctors and patients.
- Patients can see a list of doctors and their profiles.
- Doctors can see patients who chat with them.
- An appointment can be made by patients with the status "Pending" until the doctor they make an appointment with sets the status to "Accepted" or "Denied".
- Prescriptions can be added by doctors, and patients can see all of their prescriptions.
- Patients can chat with doctors for advice.
